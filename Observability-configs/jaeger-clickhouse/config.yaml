# Directory with .sql files to run at plugin startup, mainly for integration tests.
# Depending on the value of "init_tables", this can be run as a

# By default, this is enabled if init_sql_scripts_dir is empty,
# or disabled if init_sql_scripts_dir is provided.
init_tables:
# Maximal amount of spans that can be pending writes at a time.
# New spans exceeding this limit will be discarded,
# keeping memory in check if there are issues writing to ClickHouse.
# Check the "jaeger_clickhouse_discarded_spans" metric to keep track of discards.
# If 0, no limit is set. Default 10_000_000.
max_span_count:
# Batch write size. Default 10_000.
batch_write_size:
# Batch flush interval. Default 5s.
